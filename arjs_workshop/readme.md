Description:

This is a quick start for making target based augmented reality using AFrame.js and AR.js.
I put all of the dependencies into a single folder.

<strong>Instructions:</strong>

Step 1: Download or Clone the code from this repository.

Step 2: Print out the "hiro" target marker image. (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/master/data/images/HIRO.jpg)

Step 3: Set up a web server. If you need a free one to test with, try out Github.io (https://pages.github.com/).

Step 4: Open the file "index.html" in the "start" directory.

Step 5: Add fixed view elements using HTML and CSS. (Place these outside of the scene.) 

Step 6: Add 3D elements to the scene using AFrame entities. (Refer to https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/core/entity.html)

Step 7: Add JavaScript to power complex animations or other interactivity.

Step 8: Enjoy!

More things for you to try:

<ul>
<li>Create an AR Code, so that users can start your augmented reality app with a QR code scanner. (https://webxr.io/arcode-generator/)</li>

<li>Incorporate custom 3D models into your app. (Either search for "obj" file or create a file with a 3D graphics editing program.)</li>

<li>Create a custom target marker. (https://medium.com/arjs/how-to-create-your-own-marker-44becbec1105)</li>
